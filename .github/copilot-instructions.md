## Project Context

- Full-stack TODO application with React frontend and Express backend
- Focus on iterative, feedback-driven development
- Current phase: Backend stabilization and frontend feature completion

## Documentation References

- [Project overview](../docs/project-overview.md) - Architecture, tech stack, and structure
- [Testing guidelines](../docs/testing-guidelines.md) - Test patterns and standards
- [Workflow patterns](../docs/workflow-patterns.md) - Development workflow guidance

## Development Principles

- **Test-Driven Development:** Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.
- **Incremental Changes:** Make small, testable modifications.
- **Systematic Debugging:** Use test failures as guides.
- **Validation Before Commit:** Ensure all tests pass and there are no lint errors.

## Testing Scope

This project uses unit tests, integration tests, and UI end-to-end tests:

- **Backend:** Jest and Supertest for API testing
- **Frontend:** React Testing Library for component unit and integration tests
- **UI testing:** Playwright for critical user journey automation
- **Manual browser testing:** Exploratory validation and visual checks
- **Reason:** Combine fast feedback from unit and integration tests with end-to-end quality confidence from UI tests

### Testing Approach by Context

- **Backend API changes:** Write Jest tests first, then implement using the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.
- **Frontend component features:** Write React Testing Library tests first for component behavior, then implement. Follow with manual browser testing for complete UI flows.
- **True TDD:** Write the test first, then write the code needed to make it pass.

## Workflow Patterns

1. **TDD Workflow:** Write or fix tests → Run → Fail → Implement → Pass → Refactor
2. **Code Quality Workflow:** Run lint → Categorize issues → Fix systematically → Re-validate
3. **Integration Workflow:** Identify issue → Debug → Test → Fix → Verify end-to-end
4. **UI Testing Workflow:** Define critical journeys → Create UI tests → Run → Debug failures → Validate coverage

## Agent Usage

- **tdd-developer:** Use for implementation and unit/integration TDD cycles. Do not create or run Playwright UI tests in this mode.
- **code-reviewer:** Use for addressing lint errors and code quality improvements.
- **test-engineer:** Owns all Playwright UI test authoring and execution, failure triage, and isolation checks.

## Memory System

- **Persistent Memory:** This file (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`) contains foundational principles and workflows.
- **Working Memory:** The `.github/memory/` directory contains discoveries and patterns.
- During active development, take notes in `.github/memory/scratch/working-notes.md` (not committed).
- At the end of a session, summarize key findings in `.github/memory/session-notes.md` (committed).
- Document recurring code patterns in `.github/memory/patterns-discovered.md` (committed).
- Reference these files when providing context-aware suggestions.

## Workflow Utilities

GitHub CLI commands for workflow automation are available to all modes:

- List open issues: `gh issue list --state open`
- Get issue details: `gh issue view <issue-number>`
- Get an issue with comments: `gh issue view <issue-number> --comments`

The main exercise issue will have `Exercise:` in the title, and steps are posted as comments on the main issue. Use these commands when `/execute-step` or `/validate-step` prompts are invoked.

## Git Workflow

- Use conventional commit formats such as `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, and `docs:`.
- Use feature branches named `feature/<descriptive-name>`.
- Always stage all changes before committing: `git add .`
- Push to the correct branch: `git push origin <branch-name>`
